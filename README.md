# Complex naturalistic stimulus in neuroimaging

Most neuroscience experiments utilize tightly controlled stimulus in order to provide and generate results that are easily interpretable and follow simple rules of biology. At the same time, we hoped that these results could be extrapolated and reflect the neural functions of the brain in a real-world context. But to what extent do our models actually generalize outside the laboratory? What proportion of neural or behavioral variability do our models predict in real-life context? The brain encounters many issues outside a controlled laboratory setting. Evolution has nurtured brains to function in a multidimensional world where it cannot be fully characterized by simple and easily interpreted signals. Accordinignly, the knowledge about a brain derived from well-controlled stimuli is limited. 
All these issues have prompted the research community to shift towards the use of complex naturalistic stimuli to probe brain functions. As we use audiovisually rich materials to stimulate the brain, how do we correlate between neuronal responses and the stimuli and make comparisons to test hypotheses? 

## Using complex naturalistic stimulus in our lab
### Introduction: why do we need complex audiovisual stimuli for neuroimaging?
