Understanding how the brain supports behavior and cognition necessitates the unraveling of fundamental interactions within brain areas. In particular, neuroimaging can reveal the physiological forms, chemical functions, and electrical and metabolic activities of the brain. Therefore, the Lin Brain Lab focuses on developing and applying novel neuroimaging techniques that clarify the metabolic interactions in the brain. Through hardware development, nonclinical trials, and data analysis, we hope to acquire unprecedented neuroimaging and modeling. Developments of such techniques will help to enhance understanding of neural networks and functional connectivity throughout behavioral and cognitive performances. 

A prevailing neuroimaging technology used in cognitive neuroscience experiments is the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). It uses intrinsic hemodynamic response contrast to map human brain functions and study the structural and metabolics of the brain. When a particular neural region is stimulated, there is an increase of blood flow due to the increased demand for energy to process the stimulus. This technology has versatile contrasts, high sensitivity depth, and precise millimeter spatial resolution to quantify and delineate the spatial distribution of metabolites. However, MRI fails to provide good temporal resolution as the blood-oxygen response takes place within seconds. 

Electroencephalography (EEG) is another technology used in studying the human brain function non-invasively by using extracranial measurements of aggregates and concerts of electric potentials that manifest from the neurons’ response to stimulus. EEG is directly sensitive to neuronal activities and has a millisecond temporal resolution. However, it fails to yield good spatial resolution as it poorly localizes the signal sources.

Because the flaws of both EEG and fMRI are complemented by each part’s benefits, many cognitive neuroscientists are switching gears into integrating these technologies together into a multimodal EEG-fMRI system. Subjects will wear the EEG cap while lying inside the MRI, and data is collected simultaneously. Although there are artifacts involved with this multimodal system, such as pulse and gradient artifacts, corrections to these artifacts can be made when cleaning and processing the data by using Brain Vision Analyzer. In a recent publication by the Lin Brain lab, we proposed the recording of continuous EEG with sparse fast fMRI to minimize the EEG artifacts caused by the gradient coil switching. With the achieved results, we can also determine inter-subject correlation which is a modal-free approach that examines fMRI data in naturalistic environments. It provides statistical summaries of synchrony in prolonged time periods and measures the consistency of neural response to naturalistic stimuli across all subjects.
